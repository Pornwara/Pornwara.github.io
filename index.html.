        <h2>Why should I go there?</h2>
        <li>Technology is magical.</li>
        <li>I just learn today that this magically technological world exists.</li>
        <li><strong>I like to live in the world that people love creating, so I think it's important I try my best to be one of the creators.</strong></li>

        <p id="song">I want to live, I want to give<br>
I've been a miner for a heart of gold<br>
It's these expressions I never give<br>
That keep me searchin' for a heart of gold<br>
And I'm getting old<br>
Keep me searchin' for a heart of gold<br>
And I'm getting old</p>
